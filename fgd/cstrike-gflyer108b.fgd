//
// * After much testing, commented out scripted_target, scripted_sentence, cycler_actor, and generic_actor -- this leaves monster_generic and scripted_sequence for all scripted behaviour
// * Also removed vgui_screen
// * Removed all triggers' Pushables flag (it only works for func_pushable, which is not in any FGD and is pointless anyway)
// * Added avilable soundscapes to env_soundscape
// * Added _minlight key to worldspawn
// * Added Parentname base to phys_thruster and phys_torque (thanks, AberantObscurity)
// * Added HDR and other light keys, new areaportal keys, and the rest of Valve's new engine changes (the ones I could find)
// * Added ammo keys to weapons
// * Added body(integer) and SetBodyGroup(integer) to Studiomodel base; removed these from all children of Studiomodel
// * Added Parentname and Studiomodel bases to monster_generic, generic_actor, and cycler_actor
// * Added three new flags to env_blood
// * Changed spawn points to match Valve's new model names
// * Changed all studio() to studioprop() so that model bounding boxes follow the rotated model
// * Implemented func_wall, func_illusionary, func_wall_toggle, info_teleport_destination, and trigger_once at the end of the FGD for people bent on using them
// * Improved entity documentations
// * Improved prop_door_rotating (thanks, Mr. Wisecarver)

// * Removed the following nonfunctional entities:  InputFilter base; KeyFrame base; all node entities and bases; env_credits; path_corner_crash; player_loadsaved
// * Commented out the following iffy or nonfunctional entities:  ai_battle_line; ai_changehintgroup; ai_goal_assault; ai_goal_follow;
//	ai_goal_lead; ai_goal_lead_weapon; ai_goal_standoff; ai_script_conditions; ai_sound; ai_speechfilter; aiscripted_schedule;
//	assault_assaultpoint; assault_rallypoint; func_vehicleclip; logic_choreographed_scene; npc_vehicledriver; prop_vehicle; prop_vehicle_driveable

//	ammo_762mm; ammo_9mm; ammo_buckshot; item_nvgs; point_devshot_camera; spark_shower
// * Added the aforementioned ammo and item entities to game_player_equip
// * Added material browsers for vgui_screen's "Overlay Material" and trigger_vphysics_motion's "Particle Trail Material"
// * Added an Item base for item I/O
// * Added note that env_beverage and item_sodacan need a models/can.mdl, and added a link to Groundflyer's custom can
// * Added RenderFields inheritance to Studiomodel base as well as several other entities that needed it--
//	I'm pretty sure this is going to work without problems, but obviously I can't test every single entity.
// * Added a proper flag 4 to env_fade
// * Added properties and inputs to light_environment to allow it to be dynamic
// * Added _exponent key back to light_spot since it's used by RAD
// * Added MoveLinear base for func_movelinear and func_water_analog

// Raeven0 (Raeven0@editlife.net)
//
// * Removed or commented out the following broken or redundant entities:
//	env_funnel, keyframe_track, move_keyframed
// * Removed broken flag from move_rope/keyframe_rope
// * Removed broken permission flags from info_node

// * Added Alpha(integer) input in RenderFields base
// * Made the following changes to env_beam:  removed broken framrate(integer) property; renamed framestart(integer)'s
//	SmartEdit name; removed obsolete Toggle flag; renamed and rewrote flags and properties to be more accurate;
//	changed "Amplitude" input to "Noise"
// * Made the following changes to path_track:  commented out the "Fire Once" flag; made it

//
// * Removed more nonfunctional or unneeded entities:
//	BaseSpeaker base, BaseBrush base, TriggerOnce base, game_text, move_track, env_microphone, env_zoom, info_lighting_relative, trigger_once
// * Removed broken properties from cycler and added working inputs, outputs, and properties
//	I am leaving the cycler entity in, at least this time.  It's the worst possible
//	way to place a model, but it could be useful for testing purposes with model animations,
//	because you can shoot it to advance the model a frame in its animation.
//	HL2 thinks a cycler is some sort of NPC.
// * Removed Angles base from keyframe_rope
// * Removed "Spawn on Break" list from breakable objects
// * Removed choosing hostage type "A,B,C,D" since the game does it randomly anyway 
// * Added sphere(MaxRange) to env_microphone
// * Added note that, in CS:S, setting a keyframe_rope's parent breaks the entity
// * Added the Color(color255) input to the RenderFields base
//	I'm going to *try* putting this input in that base.  I hope someone tells me if it doesn't work there.
// * Added the following entities:
//	ai_battle_line; ai_changehintgroup; ai_changetarget; ai_goal_assault; ai_goal_follow; ai_goal_lead;
//	ai_goal_standoff; ai_script_conditions; ai_sound; aiscripted_schedule; assault_assaultpoint; assault_rallypoint;
//	cycler_actor; env_detail_controller; env_gunfire; env_muzzleflash; env_terrainmorph; func_vehicleclip;
//	generic_actor; logic_choreographed_scene; monster_generic; npc_vehicledriver; path_corner; path_corner_crash;
//	phys_constraintsystem; player_loadsaved; player_speedmod; prop_vehicle; prop_vehicle_driveable; scripted_sentence;
//	scripted_sequence; scripted_target; trigger_vphysics_motion
// * Added lowerleft, lowerright, upperleft, and upperright vectors to func_breakable_surf, to prevent Hammer calling foul on the entity
// * Added key no_decomp (a very simple decompile prevention method) to worldspawn
// * Moved Shadow base above Studiomodel base and had the latter call on the former (to save space)
// * Modified env_screenoverlay's properties to allow selection of materials with the texture browser
// * Emptied "Spawn on Break" list for breakable entities as there were no valid options 
// * Changed lights a little; streamlined base calling, removed unneeded properties, such as that
// * Changed "Start constrained" to "Start asleep" in weapons, and changed all instances of "Start asleep" to "Start asleep (don't fall to ground)"
// * Changed all instances of "Inverse Mass Scale" back to "Mass Scale" (I would have sworn it was inverse...)
// * Corrected more errors in spelling, punctuation, grammar, and usage
// * Changed RenderFields base (tried to make it better reflect HL2 renderfields)
// * Changed worldspawn's default sky (the old default was buggy), its help text, and removed all bases
//
// ______________________________
//
// Raeven0 (Raeven0@editlife.net), Jan 05, version 1.0.5
//
// * Removed base FGD entirely (it's better to have one FGD per mod)
// * Removed or commented out the following nonfunctional or redundant entities:
//	func_wall; func_water; func_illusionary; point_message; func_useableladder; func_ladderendpoint; game_score; game_player_team; info_ladder_dismount; info_teleport_destination
// * Removed all inputs and outputs from info_null and info_lighting (they didn't need them)
// * Removed prop_detail_base BaseClass because it wasn't needed
// * Removed obsolete flag from trigger_playermovement
// * Removed WorldBase BaseClass because it was a waste; the world's properties are now in the world itself
// * Removed a few exclusively single-player entities
// * Removed pitch/yaw/roll from env_splash
// * Removed redundant Pitch(integer) from env_sun
// * Removed the func_monitor materials from the FGD package because CS:S supports the HL2 materials
// * Commented out all physcannon properties, inputs, and outputs (there's no physcannon in CS:S!)
// * Commented out all master(string) properties of all entities.  If anyone can find an entity that can actually function as a master, I'd be glad to uncomment them.
// * Commented out redundant skins in hostage_entity
// * Commented out game_weapon_manager, since it seems to crash multiplayer games...
// * Commented out func_grenade_eater because CS:S doesn't recognize it
//
// * Added an entity called "player."  Any inputs sent to "player" will actually be passed to all the clients; however, having a player entity in the map crashes HL2.
//	I've contacted amckern, who works with CST (Source's map compiler), to see if he can have the player entity removed automatically, to avoid HL2 crashing; until then,
//	the entity will either be commented out or marked "Developer Only."
// * Added info_lighting_relative
// * Added player_weaponstrip
// * Added Targetname and Angles BaseClasses to PlayerClass base, and changed the CS spawn entities to use the new PlayerClass
// * Modified func_bomb_target, func_hostage_rescue, and func_buyzone to use the Trigger base
// * Added Parentname base to all weapons
// * Added Targetname base as well as inputs and outputs to hostage_entity
// * Added BombExplode(void) input to func_bomb_target
// * Added inputs and outputs (except OnPlayerPickup) to weapons
// * Added (and commented out) prop_physics_respawnable
// * Moved prop_physics_respawnable and prop_physics_multiplayer to be closer to prop_physics
// * Moved ignite(void) input to BasePropPhysics base instead of declaring it in the entities
// * Added Mover base to move_rope, replacing its own broken Position Interpolator property
// * Added option 2 to PositionInterpolator(choices) in the Mover base, and improved the help of that property
// * Gave func_brush a Toggle(void) input
// * Created a new base BaseDecal to save space in decals
// * Corrected filter_activator_team team numbering and added Spectator
// * Corrected problem with env_tonemap_controller SetTonemapScale input
// * Changed m_SoundName(string) to m_SoundName(sound) in point_tesla
// * Changed scale(string) and framerate(string) to scale(float) and framerate(float) in env_sprite; also, added a default value of 1 to env_sprite's scale(float)
// * Universally changed "Mass Scale" and its help to read "Inverse Mass Scale," to be more accurate
// * Gave env_sun the Targetname BaseClass
// * Gave env_steam the Targetname BaseClass
// * Plugged a few radii properties into a sphere() helper
//
// * Corrected BaseClass ordering in:
//	info_projecteddecal; func_physbox; prop_ragdoll; info_node_air_hint; material_modify_control; prop_physics; prop_dynamic; func_physbox
//	  The BaseClasses will ideally be arranged such that the Name property is always at the top,
//	  followed by any classes special to the entity.  I am open to suggestions as to the best way
//	  to arrange the BaseClasses following Targetname (such as Origin, Parentname, and Angles).
// * In order to keep the Name universally at the top, I had to create another BaseClass solely for the targetname(target_source) property.  It's called NameBase and can safely be listed as the first base in all circumstances.
// * Corrected redundant BaseClass calling in the following:
//	Trigger base; prop_dynamic_base base; BaseNPCMaker base; env_smokestack; func_monitor; func_physbox; logic_timer; trigger_hurt; trigger_remove
// * Improved the entity descriptions of:  ambient_generic, env_fog_controller, prop_detail, sky_camera
// * Made a few corrections in spelling, punctuation, grammar, and usage
// * Modified game_player_equip weapon ordering, added the weapons' "real" names, added the Use(void) input, and corrected a problem where choosing "No" gave the weapon anyway
// * Left weapons (weapon_knife, etc.) in the FGD; even though CS tries to remove them, they can be spawned with a point_template
// * Tried to apply some sort of good organization to my comments; failed miserably
//
// ------------------------------
//
// TAz00, version 1.0.2
//
// * Added point_camera
// * Added Func_monitor
// * Added materials for the monitors
//
// ------------------------------
//
// TAz00, version 1.0.1
//
// * Added a new flag to the weapons, "Start Constrained"
// * Added a new output for weapons, "OnPlayerPickup"
